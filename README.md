# Advanced GraphQL Security Testing Tool

This repository contains an advanced tool for security testing of GraphQL endpoints. The tool is designed to automate the discovery of potential vulnerabilities, perform comprehensive testing, and ensure secure handling of sensitive data. It supports advanced query and mutation testing, deep nested queries, fuzzing, role-based access control (RBAC) testing, and more.

## Features

- **Advanced Query and Mutation Testing:**
  - Deeply nested query generation to expose performance and security issues.
  - Intelligent mutation testing with sophisticated input handling and side-effect detection.
  - Recursive schema exploration to cover complex types, unions, and interfaces.

- **Concurrency and Rate Limiting:**
  - Asynchronous requests using `aiohttp` for efficient and fast enumeration.
  - Token bucket rate-limiting strategy to prevent server overload while maintaining high throughput.

- **Enhanced Input Validation Testing:**
  - Fuzzing mechanism generating diverse payloads including edge cases and injection patterns.
  - CVE-based payload testing targeting known vulnerabilities.

- **Security Improvements:**
  - Secure storage and management of sensitive information using secret management services.
  - Output sanitization to prevent inadvertent exposure of sensitive data.
  - Security testing for GraphQL subscriptions, including WebSocket-based communication.

- **Improving Test Coverage:**
  - Automated RBAC testing with different user roles.
  - Mutation impact analysis with a dry-run feature to assess potential impacts before executing mutations.

## Use Cases

- **Security Audits:** Perform in-depth security audits of GraphQL APIs, identifying potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- **Performance Testing:** Evaluate how well the GraphQL API handles deeply nested queries and complex operations, identifying performance bottlenecks.
- **Access Control Verification:** Automatically verify that role-based access controls (RBAC) are correctly enforced, ensuring that users only have access to what they should.
- **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzzing techniques to uncover edge cases and injection vulnerabilities that might be missed during manual testing.
- **Compliance:** Ensure that sensitive data is handled securely and that API behavior complies with security standards.

## Benefits

- **Comprehensive Testing:** Covers a wide range of security and performance issues with minimal manual intervention.
- **Automation:** Automates the testing process, allowing for regular and consistent testing as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Security:** Ensures that sensitive information is handled securely, with built-in features for output sanitization and secure storage.
- **Flexibility:** Supports multiple GraphQL client libraries and is highly configurable to suit various testing environments.
- **Scalability:** Asynchronous processing and rate-limiting ensure that the tool can handle large-scale testing without overwhelming the API server.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blkph0x/GraphQLook.git
   cd graphql-security-testing-tool
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up secret management (optional but recommended):**
   - Configure a secret management service to securely handle sensitive data, such as API tokens and credentials.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can configure the tool using environment variables or by creating a `config.json` file in the root of the project.

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
    "GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT": "https://example.com/graphql",
    "GRAPHQL_HEADERS": "Authorization:Bearer token,Content-Type:application/json",
    "GRAPHQL_COOKIES": "sessionid=abcd1234",
    "SAFE_PAYLOADS": "1 OR 1=1,{$ne:null},"; SELECT 1; --",
    "BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER": 1,
    "BACKOFF_MIN": 4,
    "BACKOFF_MAX": 60,
    "CLIENT_LIBRARY": "python-graphql-client",
    "SECRET_MANAGER": "your-secret-manager-config"
}
```

### Secret Management

For secure handling of sensitive data, configure a secret management service and set the `SECRET_MANAGER` variable accordingly.

## Usage

1. **Running the Tool:**

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. **Configuration:**
   - Ensure that all necessary environment variables or `config.json` settings are configured correctly.
   - The tool will automatically use the configuration settings for secure API interaction and testing.

3. **Automated Testing:**
   - The tool will perform various tests, including deep nested query generation, mutation testing, fuzz testing, and more.
   - Results will be logged, and any potential vulnerabilities or sensitive data exposures will be flagged.
